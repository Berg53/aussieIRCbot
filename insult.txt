You"re so cute when you try to concentrate! Look at you trying to think.
I can"t believe I love a stupid jerk.
Aw, come on, can"t you take a joke?
You should know how to please me by now.
I hoped you were less experienced.
Stop acting like a whore.
You are going to nickel and dime me to death!
In what world does buying that make sense?
Fine. You handle your finances. Let me know when things go to hell.
How dare you spread around our private business!
Let me do the talking; people listen to men.
You took a vow in front of God and everybody and I expect you to honor it!
If you don"t train that dog I"m going to rub your nose in its mess.
I will take our kids if you leave me.
You"re scared?! This isn"t angry! You will KNOW when I"m ANGRY!
Keep your stupid beliefs to yourself.
God will find a way to get you back, and it ain"t gonna be pretty.
I can feel myself being pulled into hell just listening to your nonsense!
